CNTDWN

A countdown timer built using JavaScript and jQuery (with HTML and CSS too). This project takes the user's inputs for title and future date and dynamically appends a timer to the bottom of the webpage. This was my first web app built with logic, which is pretty cool! When the timer is complete, the created timer box will flash red to indicate that the timer is over.
