CNTDWN 
This project was created using JavaScript and jQuery. The user is asked to input a future date, as well as a title and the program will dynamically append a countdown timer to the webpage for the user to see. This timer updates each second using setInterval, and will flash red and white when completed to visually notify the user when the timer is done!
